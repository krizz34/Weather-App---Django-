  This is my pilot project on Django. :-)
  
  This is a django project where one can find the Air Quality Index of any place in United States by just inputing the ZipCode of that particular location. This website also try to represent the obtained result in an minorly interesting way by representing different colours for different levels of AQI. One can find the space for adding the desired ZipCode on the top right of the page, where a search bar is provided for the same. By just providing the ZipCode there and clicking on the 'Check' button neest to it will provide you with the desired result.
  Thank you for reading. ;-)
